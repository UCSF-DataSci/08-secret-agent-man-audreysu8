  "title": "Death at St. Mercy Hospital",
  "setting": "Dr. Eleanor Voss, chief of cardiology at St. Mercy Hospital, was found dead in her office Monday morning. She was last seen alive at 8:00 PM Sunday evening during her overnight shift. Security footage shows no one entering or leaving the building between 11:00 PM and 5:00 AM — meaning the killer was already inside.",
  "victim": {
    "name": "Dr. Eleanor Voss",
    "role": "Chief of Cardiology",
    "found": "Monday 6:00 AM in her office (Room 401)",
    "cause_of_death": "Lethal injection of potassium chloride",
    "time_of_death_estimate": "Between 9:00 PM and 10:00 PM Sunday"
  },
  "answer": {
    "killer": "Dr. Blake",
    "weapon": "Syringe",
    "time_of_death": "9:30 PM",
    "reasoning": "Dr. Blake was the only person with access to Room 401 at 9:30 PM. The syringe found in the sharps container on Floor 4 contained potassium chloride residue. Dr. Blake's keycard accessed Floor 4 at 9:25 PM despite claiming to be in the ER. Nurse Patel saw someone in a white coat near Room 401 at 9:30 PM. Dr. Blake had motive: Dr. Voss discovered he was falsifying clinical trial data and planned to report him Monday morning."

  "suspects": {
    "dr_blake": {
      "name": "Dr. Raymond Blake",
      "role": "Cardiologist, Dr. Voss's protégé",
      "motive": "Dr. Voss discovered he was falsifying data in a major clinical trial. She confronted him Sunday afternoon and told him she would report him to the medical board Monday morning. His career, reputation, and freedom were at stake.",
      "statement": "I was in the ER all evening covering for Dr. Santos who called in sick. I didn't go above the second floor all night. I heard about Dr. Voss this morning and I'm devastated — she was my mentor."
    },
    "nurse_chen": {
      "name": "Nurse Margaret Chen",
      "role": "Senior ICU Nurse",
      "motive": "Dr. Voss had filed a formal complaint about medication errors on Chen's shifts. Chen was facing a disciplinary hearing next week that could end her 20-year career.",
      "statement": "I was on the ICU floor (Floor 3) all night. I took my break at 9:00 PM in the third-floor break room and was back on the floor by 9:20 PM. I never went to Floor 4."
    },
    "dr_santos": {
      "name": "Dr. Maria Santos",
      "role": "Emergency Medicine physician",
      "motive": "Dr. Voss blocked her promotion to department head last year, citing 'lack of leadership qualities.' Santos was still angry about it.",
      "statement": "I called in sick Sunday but came back to the hospital around 8:30 PM because I forgot my laptop in my office on Floor 2. I grabbed it and left by 9:15 PM. The front desk can confirm I signed out."
    },
    "orderly_james": {
      "name": "Victor James",
      "role": "Night orderly",
      "motive": "Dr. Voss caught him stealing controlled substances from the pharmacy last month. She gave him a 'last chance' warning instead of reporting him, but he lived in fear she'd change her mind.",
      "statement": "I was doing my rounds — moving equipment, restocking supply closets. I was on Floor 1 from 8:00 to 9:00, Floor 2 from 9:00 to 10:00, and Floor 3 from 10:00 to 11:00. I never went to Floor 4 on Sunday night."
